# BlueTooth Test system

BLtest.py is a python code to run on a Raspberry pi 3 to test a Bluetooth RFCOMM connection with Android
(See repo https://github.com/TheFwGuy/BLtest for the Android app)
The code is configured to run at the startup.

The code supports 3 different configurations :

1) LCD with pushbuttons (Adafruit Char-LCD)
2) LCD micro (Adafruit SSD1306)
3) TFT

The code is trying to identify what configuration is set up and use it.

See more information on my blog.
